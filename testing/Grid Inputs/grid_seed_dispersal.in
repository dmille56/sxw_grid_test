# Seed dispersal setup for STEPWAT grid version - DLM 06-27-13.  This file contains constants that are used in seed dispersal.

0.125		# probability that the microenvironmental conditions required for the germination and establishment of B. gracilis seedlings will occur in a given year

27.0		# minimum biomass that is required for seeds to be produced in g/m2 (49.0 g/m2 in the paper)

#CONSTANTS from the function: Ps = 1.0 - 0.99*exp( C1*(LYPPT-C2))... where Ps is the probability that seeds of B.gracilis are present in the plot and LYPPT is last years precipitation in mm
-0.0018953	# C1 in the equation... (-0.0018953 in the paper)
105			# C2 in the equation... represents the dryest year in mm (105 in the paper)

#CONSTANTS from the max distance function: MAXD = (H * VW) / VT.  MAXD refers to the maximum distance that a seed can be dispersed to.  If you're MAXD ends up being really small, then you can get kinda weird results, so be careful.
30.0		# H - the average release height of the inflorescences (30 cm in the paper)
500.0		# VW - the mean horizontal wind speed (500 cm/sec in the paper)
100.0		# VT - the average sinking velocity of the seeds (100 cm/sec in the paper)
