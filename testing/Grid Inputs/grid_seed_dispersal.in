# Seed dispersal setup for STEPWAT grid version - DLM 07-29-13.  This file contains constants that are used in seed dispersal.  The rest of the seed dispersal inputs are set up on a species basis in the species input file.

#0.125		# probability that the microenvironmental conditions required for the germination and establishment of B. gracilis seedlings will occur in a given year

#6.5		# minimum biomass that is required for seeds to be produced in g/m2 (49.0 g/m2 in the paper)

#CONSTANTS from the function: Ps = 1.0 - 0.99*exp( C1*(LYPPT-C2))... where Ps is the probability that seeds of B.gracilis are present in the plot and LYPPT is last years precipitation in mm
#-0.0018953	# C1 in the equation... (-0.0018953 in the paper)
#105		# C2 in the equation... represents the dryest year in mm (105 in the paper)

#CONSTANTS from the max distance function: MAXD = (H * VW) / VT.  MAXD refers to the maximum distance that a seed can be dispersed to.  If you're MAXD ends up being really small, then you can get kinda weird results, so be careful.
#30.0		# H - the average release height of the inflorescences (30 cm in the paper)
500.0		# VW - the mean horizontal wind speed (500 cm/sec in the paper)
#100.0		# VT - the average sinking velocity of the seeds (100 cm/sec in the paper)

#SEED DISPERSAL OUTPUTS
1		# output seed dispersal (ie. the total probability that a cell received seeds for each cell for each year for each species)?  1 means yes, 0 means no
1		# output header (ie. the names of all the species)?  1 means yes, 0 means no.  Suggested: yes, as it's hard to figure out what all the numbers mean elsewise.
t		# output seperator... specify one of the following as a separator: t = tab, s = space, or any single character such as , | : etc (excluding '#','t', and 's').  Suggested: tab.
