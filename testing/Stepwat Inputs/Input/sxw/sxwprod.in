#Production Coefficients for STEPWAT

# These values are used to convert yearly biomass
# from STEPPE to monthly production values for SOILWAT

# BMASS - convert STEPPE's total biomass values (g/m^2) to
#         aboveground biomass (g/m^2). Needn't sum to 1.
#         This is a percent of the total yearly biomass.
#         (STEPPE's yearly vals are converted to monthly).
# LITTER - use the maximum value from the converted biomass 
#          to multiply by this number to compute a litter 
#          value in g/m^2.  Needn't sum to 1.0.
