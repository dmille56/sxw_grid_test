# precipitation: truncated normal distribution.  To force ppt
# to be a single value, set avg, min and max to that value.
#
# avg = (mm)
# std = (mm) standard deviation
# min = truncate to this minimum
# max = truncate to this maximum
# dry = ppt <= this is treated as a dry year (eqn 3)
# wet = ppt >= this is treated as a wet year (eqn 4)
#       anything between "dry" and "wet" is considered average
# gsppt = proportion of ppt occuring during growing season

# use == use (1) / don't use (0) this disturbance
# occur = probability of occurrance
# min = minimum number of years before plants can begin
#       reestablishment after the initiation of the ant mound.
# max = maximum number of years to exclude plants due to ant mound.
# The actual number chosen is a uniform random distribution.

#  In the C&L 1990 paper, plants can reestablish beginning
# immediately after this disturbance.  However, you can change

# Immediate reestablishment potential is denoted by min=0 years.
