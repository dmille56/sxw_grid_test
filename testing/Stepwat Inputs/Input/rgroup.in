#                Group definitions
# name = a name to give the group (12 chars)
# space = proportion of the resource space used by the group.
#         this must sum to 1.0
# density = relative number of mature individuals per plot
# maxest = maximum species that can establish in a given year
# slow = slow growth rate, defines when to count stretched years
# stretch  = max yrs resources can be stretched before low-resource
#                    mortality occurs.
# xres   = 1 = use other groups' extra resources, 0 = can't use
# estann = establish annually if 1; if 0, establishment
#          for this group is random from year to year.
# on = switch to turn off this group, ie, don't produce any
#       of the plants in this group.  1=on, 0=off.
# startyr = do not attempt to grow this group until this year.
#        especially useful for invasives.
# killyr = kill all members of this group at end of this year.
#          0 == don't kill
# killfrq = frequency to kill.  if < 1, yearly probability,
#            if > 1 yearly interval, after start year (start).  
#            Overrides killyr.
#            See also disturbances in environmental parameter file.
# extirp = year at which all group members are extirpated
#       (without recovery) from the plot. 0==don't use, >0 == year # 
# mort =  switch to allow age-independent/slowgrowth mortality
#         functions. eg, bouteloua and succulents are excluded,
#         but others might be excluded for testing purposes.
#         0 = don't use; 1 = use.
# xgrow = extra growth factor; if > 0, plants can convert "extra" ppt
#         into ephemeral (this year's) biomass by
#         grams_extra_biomass = mm_extra_ppt * xgrow_factor
# veg_prod_type = 1 for tree, 2 for shrub, & 3 for grass.  Refer to soilwat's VegProd types in VegProd.h.
