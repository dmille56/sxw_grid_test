/* This section defines some shorthands for loops.  There is a
 * serious tendency in this program toward off-by-one errors
 * because some arrays, eg, the main plant data structures such
 * as RGroup[], RGroup[]->est_spp, etc etc, work better with a
 * base of 1 (ie, no plant #0 exists) and some, such as the
 * temporary arrays for sorting etc, are much more naturally
 * treated as normal C arrays.  This was a design issue made
 * at the start of the process--to think of accessing groups,
 * species, and plants as #1, #2, etc--it has helped much more
 * than it hindered, but it remains to be seen whether that
 * will hold out for someone else.
 *
 * To mitigate the negative, I created these macros to maintain
 * consistency and to make the code somewhat more readable.
 *
 * Well, eventually the limitations became horribly apparent.
 * I spent a couple of months debugging diabolical errors that
 * taught me a lot about memory management.  Number 1: don't
 * mix base0 and base1 arrays.  Off-by-1 random memory overwrites
 * drove me to distraction and forced the recoding of all the
 * arrays to start at 0 and the redefining of the macros below
 * to start at 0.  I'm glad I had all the loops coded as these
 * macros, because that helped quite a bit.
