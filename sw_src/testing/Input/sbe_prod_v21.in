# Litter   - dead leafy material on the ground (g/m^2 ).
# Biomass  - living and dead/woody aboveground standing biomass (g/m^2).
# %Live    - proportion of Biomass that is actually living (0-1.0).
# LAI_conv - monthly amount of biomass needed to produce LAI=1.0 (g/m^2).
# There should be 12 rows, one for each month, starting with January.
